# Mutual-Exclusion-Algorithm-for-Synchronization
Contains test-and-set(), compare-and-awap() and Bounded Waiting compare-and-swap() algorithms for mutual exclusion. These Algorithms solve the critical-section problem in a relatively simple manner.

Input should be given using file "inp-params.txt" consisting of the following parameters:
1. n, no. of processes
2. k, no. of times each process will enter the critical section
3. lambda1, average of exponentially distributed time for which each process remain in critical section.
4. lambda2, average of exponentially distributed time for which each process remain in remainder section.
